<hr>

<p>In this project, an online store has been implemented. In that project, there are various sections including shopping cart,
  orders, product filtering, etc. The important point in this project is that the shopping cart section has been implemented using a database, 
  which is one of the methods of the mod. There are other methods, such as implementation with a session, which has been discussed in another repository.</p>
